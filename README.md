# wordpress-redirect-to-front
Wordpress plugin that allows automatic redirects to front page when enabled.

When Wordpress sites are single-page, they often don't want to include a blog. In order to handle 404-page creation or allowing people to visit pages/posts they're not supposed to, this plugin redirects all traffic to the front-page. Use this when you want to create a single-page site where only the front-page is important.
